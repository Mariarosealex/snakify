#here was a set of cards with numbers from 1 to N. One of the card is now lost. Determine the number on that lost card given the numbers for the remaining cards.Given a number N, followed by N âˆ’ 1 integers - representing the numbers on the remaining cards (distinct integers in the range from 1 to N). Find and print the number on the lost card.
a = int(input())  
sum = a * (a + 1) // 2  
p = 0

for i in range(a - 1):  
    
    n = int(input())
    p += n

print( sum - p)
